# C - Makefiles

This project is aimed at mastering Makefile construction with the following components:

- **Tests**: Inside the `tests` folder, you'll find various test files.
- **Helper Files**: 
  - `school.c`: Contains a function displaying a seahorse in text.
  - `main.c`: Executes the function from `school.c`.
- **Header File**: 
  - `m.h`: Defines function prototypes used in `school.c`.

## Tasks:

1. **0-Makefile**: Generates an executable `school` using `school.c` and `main.c`.
2. **1-Makefile**: Extends the previous Makefile by defining compiler and source files.
3. **2-Makefile**: Further improves the previous Makefile by defining object files and the executable's name.
4. **3-Makefile**: Adds cleaning and recompilation rules, along with deletion commands.
5. **4-Makefile**: Enhances compilation with additional compiler flags.
6. **5-island_perimeter.py**: Contains a Python function returning the perimeter of an island in a grid.
7. **100-Makefile**: An advanced Makefile with additional conditions and optimizations.
